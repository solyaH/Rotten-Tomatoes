    "quote": "A charming reworking of the classic Cinderella story, Billy Wilder's Sabrina featurs a terrific cast, headed by William Holden, Humphrey Bogart (in a comedy role!), and best of all Audrey Hepburn."

    "quote": "Script is long on glibly quipping dialog, dropped with a seemingly casual air, and broadly played situations. The splendid trouping delivers them style. Leavening the chuckles are tugs at the heart."

    "publication": "New York Times",
    "quote": "It is a story as light as a feather and as old as yesterday's news, as transparent as a society column item and as smug as a foreign-made car. But Mr. Wilder...has made it into a commentary as crisp as a screed in a smart magazine."

    "quote": "It's a Cinderella story that gets turned on its head, a satire about breaking down class and emotional barriers, and a confrontation between New World callousness and Old World humanity."
